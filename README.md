# AppDynamics Monitoring Extension for use with IBM WebSphere MQ

## Use case
Websphere MQ, formerly known as MQ (message queue) series, is an IBM standard for program-to-program messaging across multiple platforms. 

The WebSphere MQ monitoring extension can monitor multiple queues managers and their resources, namely queues, topics, channels and listeners The metrics are extracted out using the [PCF command messages](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSFKSJ_8.0.0/com.ibm.mq.adm.doc/q020010_.htm).

The metrics for queue manager, queue, topic, channel and listener can be configured.

The MQ Monitor currently supports IBM Websphere MQ version 7.x, 8.x and 9.x.
 
## Prerequisites
In order to use this extension, you do need a [Standalone JAVA Machine Agent](https://docs.appdynamics.com/display/PRO44/Standalone+Machine+Agents) or [SIM Agent](https://docs.appdynamics.com/display/PRO44/Server+Visibility).  For more details on downloading these products, please  visit https://download.appdynamics.com/.

If this extension is configured for **CLIENT** transport type
1. Please make sure the MQ's host and port is accessible. 
2. Credentials of user with correct access rights would be needed in config.yml [(Access Permissions section)](https://github.com/Appdynamics/websphere-mq-monitoring-extension#access-permissions).
3. If the hosting OS for IBM MQ is Windows, Windows user credentials will be needed.  

### Dependencies  
The extension has a dependency on the following jar's depending on IBM MQ version:

* v8.0.0 and above
```
com.ibm.mq.allclient.jar
```
* For other versions
``` 
com.ibm.mq.commonservices.jar
com.ibm.mq.jar
com.ibm.mq.jmqi.jar
com.ibm.mq.headers.jar
com.ibm.mq.pcf.jar
dhbcore.jar
connector.jar
```

These jar files are typically found in ```/opt/mqm/java/lib``` on a UNIX server but may be found in an alternate location depending upon your environment. 

In case of **CLIENT** transport type, IBM MQ Client must be installed to get the MQ jars. To download IBM MQ Client jars, see [here](https://developer.ibm.com/messaging/mq-downloads/)

## Installation
1. To build from source, clone this repository and run `mvn clean install` from websphere-mq-monitoring-extension directory. This will produce a WMQMonitor-\<version\>.zip in target directory. Alternatively download the latest release archive from [here](https://github.com/Appdynamics/websphere-mq-monitoring-extension/releases).
2. Unzip contents of WMQMonitor-\<version\>.zip file and copy to <code><machine-agent-dir>/monitors</code> directory. Do not place the extension in the "extensions" directory of your Machine Agent installation directory.
3. There are two transport modes in which this extension can be run
   * **Binding** : Requires WMQ Extension to be deployed in machine agent on the same machine where WMQ server is installed.  
   * **Client** : In this mode, the WMQ extension is installed on a different host than the IBM MQ server. Please install the [IBM MQ Client](https://developer.ibm.com/messaging/mq-downloads/) for this mode to get the necessary jars as mentioned previously. 
4. Edit the classpath element in WMQMonitor/monitor.xml with the path to the required jar files.
   ```
    <classpath>websphere-mq-monitoring-extension.jar;/opt/mqm/java/lib/com.ibm.mq.allclient.jar</classpath>
   ```
   OR
   ```
    <classpath>websphere-mq-monitoring-extension.jar;/opt/mqm/java/lib/com.ibm.mq.jar;/opt/mqm/java/lib/com.ibm.mq.jmqi.jar;/opt/mqm/java/lib/com.ibm.mq.commonservices.jar;/opt/mqm/java/lib/com.ibm.mq.headers.jar;/opt/mqm/java/lib/com.ibm.mq.pcf.jar;/opt/mqm/java/lib/connector.jar;/opt/mqm/java/lib/dhbcore.jar</classpath>
   ```
5. If you plan to use **Client** transport type, create a channel of type server connection in each of the queue manager you wish to query. 
6. Edit the config.yml file.  An example config.yml file follows these installation instructions.
7. Restart the Machine Agent.

## Configuration
**Note** : Please make sure to not use tab (\t) while editing yaml files. You may want to validate the yaml file using a [yaml validator](http://yamllint.com/)
Configure the monitor by editing the config.yml file in <code><machine-agent-dir>/monitors/WMQMonitor/</code>.
1. Configure the metricPrefix with the `<TIER_ID` under which this extension metrics need to be reported. For example
   ```
    metricPrefix: "Server|Component:100|Custom Metrics|WebsphereMQ|"
   ```  
2. Each queueManager requires 9 threads to fetch its metrics concurrently and 1 main thread to run the extension. So if for example, there are 2 queueManagers configured, please set the numberOfThreads to be 19 (2*9+1)
   ```
    numberOfThreads: 20
   ```
3. Configure the queueManages with appropriate fields and filters. Below sample consists of 2 queueManagers. 
   ```
    queueManagers:
      - displayName: ""
        # displayName (optional). This will be your QM name that will show up in AppD metric path. If empty, name (below) will show up.

        #for client type connection change it to "Client".
        transportType: "Client"
        ##for user access level, please check "Access Permissions" section on the extensions page, no need to provide credentials in case of bindings transport type, it is only applicable for client type

5. To run the extension at a frequency > 1 minute, please configure the taskSchedule section. Refer to the [Task Schedule](https://community.appdynamics.com/t5/Knowledge-Base/Task-Schedule-for-Extensions/ta-p/35414) doc for details.

### Extension Working - Internals
This extension extracts metrics through [PCF framework](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFKSJ_8.0.0/com.ibm.mq.adm.doc/q019990_.htm). A complete list of PCF commands are listed [here](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFKSJ_7.5.0/com.ibm.mq.ref.adm.doc/q086870_.htm)
Each queue manager has an administration queue with a standard queue name and the extension sends PCF command messages to that queue. On Windows and Unix platforms, the PCF commands are sent is always sent to the SYSTEM.ADMIN.COMMAND.QUEUE queue. 
More details about that is mentioned [here](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFKSJ_8.0.0/com.ibm.mq.adm.doc/q020010_.htm)

By default, the PCF responses are sent to the SYSTEM.DEFAULT.MODEL.QUEUE. Using this queue causes a temporary dynamic queue to be created. You can override the default here by using the `modelQueueName` and `replyQueuePrefix` fields in the config.yml.
More details mentioned [here](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFKSJ_7.5.0/com.ibm.mq.ref.adm.doc/q083240_.htm)

### Access Permissions
If you are in **Bindings** mode, please make sure to start the MA process under a user which has the following permissions on the broker. Similarly, for **Client** mode, please provide the user credentials in config.yml which have permissions listed below.

The user connecting to the queueManager should have the inquire, get, put (since PCF responses cause dynamic queues to be created) permissions. For metrics that execute MQCMD_RESET_Q_STATS command, chg permission is needed.

### SSL Support
1. Configure the IBM SSL Cipher Suite in the config.yml.
    Note that, to use some CipherSuites the unrestricted policy needs to be configured in JRE. Please visit [this link](http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSYKE2_8.0.0/com.ibm.java.security.component.80.doc/security-component/sdkpolicyfiles.html
    ) for more details. For Oracle JRE, please update with [JCE Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jce8-download-2133166.html). The download includes a readme file with instructions on how to apply these files to JRE

2. Please add the following JVM arguments to the MA start up command or script. 

    ```-Dcom.ibm.mq.cfg.useIBMCipherMappings=false```  (If you are using IBM Cipher Suites, set the flag to true. Please visit [this link](http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSFKSJ_8.0.0/com.ibm.mq.dev.doc/q113210_.htm) for more details.
    )
3. To configure SSL, the MA's trust store and keystore needs to be setup with the JKS filepath. They can be passed either as Machine Agent JVM arguments or configured in config.yml (sslConnection) <br />
    
    a. Machine Agent JVM arguments as follows:

    ```-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=<PATH_TO_JKS_FILE>```<br />
    ```-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=<PASS>```<br />
    ```-Djavax.net.ssl.keyStore=<PATH_TO_JKS_FILE>```<br />
    ```-Djavax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword=<PASS>```<br />
    
    b. sslConnection in config.yml, configure the trustStorePassword or trustStoreEncryptedPassword based on Credentials Encryption. Same holds for keyStore configuration as well. 
    
    ```
    sslConnection:
      trustStorePath: ""
      trustStorePassword: ""
      trustStoreEncryptedPassword: ""
    
      keyStorePath: ""
      keyStorePassword: ""
      keyStoreEncryptedPassword: ""
    ```

## Metrics
The metrics will be reported under the tree ```Application Infrastructure Performance|$TIER|Custom Metrics|WebsphereMQ```

## Credentials Encryption
Please visit [this page](https://community.appdynamics.com/t5/Knowledge-Base/How-to-use-Password-Encryption-with-Extensions/ta-p/29397) to get detailed instructions on password encryption. The steps in this document will guide you through the whole process.

## Extensions Workbench
Workbench is an inbuilt feature provided with each extension in order to assist you to fine tune the extension setup before you actually deploy it on the controller. Please review the following document on [How to use the Extensions WorkBench](https://community.appdynamics.com/t5/Knowledge-Base/How-to-use-the-Extensions-WorkBench/ta-p/30130)

## Troubleshooting
1. Please follow the steps listed in this [troubleshooting-document](https://community.appdynamics.com/t5/Knowledge-Base/How-to-troubleshoot-missing-custom-metrics-or-extensions-metrics/ta-p/28695) in order to troubleshoot your issue. These are a set of common issues that customers might have faced during the installation of the extension. If these don't solve your issue, please follow the last step on the troubleshooting-document to contact the support team.
2. Error `Completion Code '2', Reason '2495'`
   Normally this error occurs if the environment variables are not set up correctly for this extension to work MQ in Bindings Mode.
   
   If you are seeing `Failed to load the WebSphere MQ native JNI library: 'mqjbnd'`, please add the following jvm argument when starting the MA. 
   
   -Djava.library.path=\<path to libmqjbnd.so\> For eg. on Unix it could -Djava.library.path=/opt/mqm/java/lib64 for 64-bit or -Djava.library.path=/opt/mqm/java/lib for 32-bit OS
   
   Sometimes you also have run the setmqenv script before using the above jvm argument to start the machine agent. 
   
   . /opt/mqm/bin/setmqenv -s 
   
   For more details, please check this [doc](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSFKSJ_7.1.0/com.ibm.mq.doc/zr00610_.htm)
   
   This might occour due to various reasons ranging from incorrect installation to applying [ibm fix packs](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21410038) but most of the time it happens when you are trying to connect in `Bindings` mode and machine agent is not on the same machine on which WMQ server is running. If you want to connect to WMQ server from a remote machine then connect using `Client` mode.
   
   Another way to get around this issue is to avoid using the Bindings mode. Connect using CLIENT transport type from a remote box.

3. Error `Completion Code '2', Reason '2035'`
   This could happen for various reasons but for most of the cases, for **Client** mode the user specified in config.yml is not authorized to access the queue manager. Also sometimes even if userid and password are correct, channel auth (CHLAUTH) for that queue manager blocks traffics from other ips, you need to contact admin to provide you access to the queue manager.
   For Bindings mode, please make sure that the MA is owned by a mqm user. Please check [this doc](https://www-01.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21636093) 
  
4. MQJE001: Completion Code '2', Reason '2195'
   This could happen in **Client** mode. Please make sure that the IBM MQ dependency jars are correctly referenced in classpath of monitor.xml 

5. MQJE001: Completion Code '2', Reason '2400'
   This could happen if unsupported cipherSuite is provided or JRE not having/enabled unlimited jurisdiction policy files. Please check SSL Support section.

## Support Tickets
If after going through the Troubleshooting Document you have not been able to get your extension working, please file a ticket and add the following information.

Please provide the following in order for us to assist you better.  

1. Stop the running machine agent .
2. Delete all existing logs under \<MachineAgent\>/logs .
3. Please enable debug logging by editing the file \<MachineAgent\>/conf/logging/log4j.xml. Change the level value of the following \<logger\> elements to debug.      
   * \<logger name="com.singularity"\>
   * \<logger name="com.appdynamics"\>
4. Start the machine agent and please let it run for 10 mins. Then zip and upload all the logs in the directory \<MachineAgent\>/logs/*.
5. Attach the zipped \<MachineAgent\>/conf/* directory here.
6. Attach the zipped \<MachineAgent\>/monitors/WMQMonitor directory here.

For any support related questions, you can also contact help@appdynamics.com.
